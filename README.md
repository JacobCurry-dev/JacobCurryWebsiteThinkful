# JacobCurryWebsiteThinkful
This is my first portfolio webpage for myself that I am making for my final assessment for the Thinkful Prep Course. There are 3 main sections to the page. One for "Introduction", "About Jacob", one for "Contact Jacob".
At the bottom of the page, there are also links to my Github account profile, as well as my LinkedIn profile.

Also, I did want to put a picture up on the webpage, but I don't have any quality pictures of myself from any time in the last 2 years, so I decided pictureless would be more professional than having a sub-par quality photo.
