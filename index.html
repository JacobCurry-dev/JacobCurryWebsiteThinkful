        <article>I am a software developer currently living in Morgantown, West Virginia. I have a bit of experience in many fields, from general labor to sales, but have recently discovered my passion for coding!
          <section>
            <p>Some of the things I enjoy are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Writing stories and pieces of code so I can create my own game in the future.</li>
                <li>Spending time and collaborating with friends on creative and professional projects.</li>
                <li>Meeting and working with like-minded developers.</li>
              </ul>

        <article>
          <section>
            <p>For a long time, I always was somebody who would struggle with finding a career or field that I both was good at and enjoyed doing. After a few years of jumping between school and working, the company I was working with closing down due to the pandemic in early 2020.</p>
            <p>After just getting any job I could during that time, I decided enough was enough and I wanted to develop new skills that would not only allow me to do something I enjoy, but also something I can continually learn and improve at. Now, here I am!</p>
            <p>If you are looking to work with a developer that is great in a team setting or who is comfortable working on some solo projects, I'm your guy! I am looking forward to seeing what amazing projects we can work together on!</p>
